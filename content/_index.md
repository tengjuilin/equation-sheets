## Introduction

This repository contains equations that I learned and used in science and engineering courses at the University of Washington. Current topics include calculus, applied mathematics, chemistry, physics, and chemical engineering.

You can download pdf of the equation sheets in this repository or view them [online](http://tengjuilin.netlify.app/resources/equation-sheets/). The online version is most up-to-date, and it's also configured to be printable.

If you like this resource, feel free to [star](https://github.com/tengjuilin/intro-sci-computing/stargazers), [watch](https://github.com/tengjuilin/intro-sci-computing/watchers), or [fork](https://github.com/tengjuilin/intro-sci-computing/network/members).

If you find any mistakes, please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/tengjuilin/equation-sheets/issues/new).
