# Equation Sheets
This repository hosts equations I learned and used in science and engineering courses at the University of Washington. Current topics include chemistry and physics. Future topics include calculus, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering.

You could download pdf of the equation sheets in this repository or view them [online](http://polarize.pw/equation/index.html). The online version is most up-to-date.
